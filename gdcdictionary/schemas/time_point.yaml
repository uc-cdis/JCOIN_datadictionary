  visit_month:
    description: >
      The formatted name of the visit. This may Baseline
      or a month Follow-up (e.g., 1 month, 2 month...24 month).
      
      > Note, this does not correspond to the actual month of the visit. 
      Rather, it corresponds to the intended visit month. For example,
      if a study has a 3 month visit but the participant could not 
      come in until 4 months after baseline, this will still be called "3 month."

      To get an exact time since baseline, see `days_from_baseline_session`.

  shifted_visit_dt:
    description: >
      The visit date of a given time point which is shifted by a random fixed number of days (182 days before or after the actual date)
      within an individual. 

      The fixed (ie same shift amount within each individual), random shift provides date de-identification while retaining 
      the interval between these (de-identified) dates.
